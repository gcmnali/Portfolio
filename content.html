    <p style="font-size: 2em;">I started to painting as a hobby. 
      <br>For a long time I have had a strong desire to start but somehow I could not accomplish.

        <h2>Powercoders</h2>
        <p>
          Last week was very busy and tiring. It was full of activities and lessons. 
          <br> But I've learnt too much. Also meeting new people and <strong>breaking ices</strong> were very helpful to me.
          <br> I am happy to be a participant of Powercoders. I hope I will be succesful at the end, and 
          <br> I can find an intership.
